Portfolio Site Engineering Journal

Goal:

Build a static, high performant, and mobile responsive software engineering portfolio website from scratch. The modern UI includes a single scrollable page and contact form. Components will be decoupled and open-source tools are used to keep this future-proof and maintainable.

To demonstrate holistic development skills, it is important to document the project and engineering decisions.
