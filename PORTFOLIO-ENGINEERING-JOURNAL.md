Portfolio Site Engineering Journal

Goal:

Build a static, high performant, and mobile responsive software engineering portfolio website from scratch. The modern UI includes a single scrollable page and contact form. Components will be decoupled and open-source tools are used to keep this future-proof and maintainable.

To demonstrate holistic development skills, it is important to document the project and engineering decisions.

Phases:

Planning Phase:
 - User flow: identify purpose/expected flow of a portfolio site (why ppl are viewing), recruiter, client?
 - Researching technologies (libraries to use, hosting service, UI mock software)
 - Design UI Mock (mobile and desktop)

Building Phase:
 - Development (writing code)  - Best practices (linter, static analysis)
 - Deployment

Testing Phase:
 - Google Lighthouse (performance, set, and a11y testing)

Monitoring:
 - Google 
 - Google Search Console
 - Uptime tool: https://github.com/upptime/upptime
 - HeroTofu: contact form

Conclusion:

I learned XYZ. It took N weeks

MORE NOTES:
Work backwards - What recruiters want to see on the website?? Must have sections

How to ORDER the sections - average use spends XX seconds on website 

DONT REINVENT THE WHEEL - Find successful developers already, study them

KISS. Development/maintainers took so long for the other website. I had no desire to update it. Long term maintainer is crucial, so it doesn’t become stale. I wanted my website to be so modern and fancy, it took away from the practicality of it. If someone clicks away, all that effort was wasted

#### 3/8 notes
To break down the UX design process into smaller steps, here is what i did:

-Minimum required components
-General layout of components (desktop)
-General layout for mobile!!
-General color/backgrounds of components
-Styling of components (color, border, border radius)
-Spacing of components
-Animation of components (+hover style)
